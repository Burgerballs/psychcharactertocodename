# psychcharactertocodename
Converts Psych Engine character metadata to a Codename Engine formatted XML.

TO USE THIS FILE, ENTER `python psychjsontocodenamexml.py <YOUR FILE NAME>.json` into your CLI

The releases have an accompanying "config.json", make sure that it is in the same directory as the script or I will eat your skin and drink your fluids!

YOU NEED PYTHON INSTALLED TOO BTW!!!
